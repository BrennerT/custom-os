# Custom OS based on Universal Blue Images

This repository is used to build a custom os image with preinstalled software for me. For this I use the [universial blue image template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template).
You can find further information on how to use those images on their repository.
> NOTE: For now i'm only testing if i could replace my nixos based setup with this.
